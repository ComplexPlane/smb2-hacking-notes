# Monkey Ball Community Hacking Notes

A place for everybody's freeform notes relating to hacking/reversing/modding Super Monkey Ball 1 and 2's code, file formats, etc.

This is intended to complement the community Ghidra decompilation, contact ComplexPlane for more information.

## Directory Structure

For now, notes are separated into a directory per user - feel free to contribute to other people's notes though!

The `smbinfo` directory contains the contents of the old `smbinfo` notes repository, sans TwixNinja's notes which have been moved to the top level.
