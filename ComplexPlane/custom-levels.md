yeah, you use ws2lzfrontend on the .xml file. this gives you a .lz.raw file, you use SMBLzTool ( which you can get here: https://bobjrsenior.pw/smb  )  to convert that to a .lz.raw.lz file. then you rename that .lz.raw.lz file to a file that's named 'STAGE###.lz', where ### is the stage slot you want to replace in smb2. here is a list of stage slots to see where you're replacing https://pastebin.com/90BERE6p. you then rename the .gma and .tpl files to 'st###.gma' and 'st###.tpl' where ### is the stage slot mentioned previously, and then you import that into your game
